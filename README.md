# MIP-BIP Optimization
This project uses mixed integer programming and binary integer programming to optimize a 
problem set of two "classic" optimization problems, bin packing and knapsack. Two problem 
sets are described and data is given, then it is up to the student to pick what kind of 
problem it is and write a formulation for the problem. The next step is to program a 
Python-Gurobi model using the formulations created and finally write a short summary of 
the solution found.
